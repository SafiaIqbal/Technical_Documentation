            <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design web pages on the internet. HTML provides the basic structure of a webpage, which is then enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, italicize words, make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>
            <p>For example, the (p) tag defines a paragraph, the (a) tag defines a hyperlink, and the (img) tag is used to embed an image in a webpage. HTML is a fundamental technology for web development and is essential for creating structured content on the web.</p>

            <header>What is CSS?</header>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed on the screen, paper, or in other media.</p>
            <p>CSS saves a lot of work by controlling the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files, which makes it easy to change the look and feel of an entire website by editing one file.</p>
            <p>CSS can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. For example, you can use CSS to change the color of all the headings on your website, or to change the font style of all the paragraphs. CSS is a powerful tool for web designers and developers, allowing them to create visually appealing and responsive websites.</p>
