            <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design web pages on the internet. HTML provides the basic structure of a webpage, which is then enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, italicize words, make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>
            <p>For example, the (p) tag defines a paragraph, the (a) tag defines a hyperlink, and the (img) tag is used to embed an image in a webpage. HTML is a fundamental technology for web development and is essential for creating structured content on the web.</p>
